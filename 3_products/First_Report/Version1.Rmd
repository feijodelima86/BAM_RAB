# Preliminary Analyses

This document contains preliminary analyses regarding the BAM_RAB data set as it stands. These preliminary analyses focus on the following elements: As,Cd,Cu,Fe,Pb,Se and Zn. These elements were selected based on interest in the "Big 5" contaminants of concern plus Fe due to our interest in particle formation. I also added Se given the current interests of our extended research group, as well as some interesting parallels between the behavior of Se and Zn.

## 1. Temporal patterns in metal accumulation in biomass contents (mg/g).

The following figures represent the patterns for all samples over time within the three biomass compartments, all sites included. The code for generation all these figures is located under 1_code/2_RFL_Presentation_Figures/1_Barplots_Time_All.R

Arsenic (Fig.1) seems to be the only element that actually decreases over time as the growing season progresses. I think this would be the main suspect when we actually try to trace the relationship between metals in algae and metals in water.

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Figure 1.1: Arsenic content of benthic biomass compartments over time.", out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("Figures/1.jpeg")
```

For most metals, patterns are pretty similar (Figs. 2,3,4,5).

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Figure 1.2: Cadmium content of benthic biomass compartments over time.", out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("Figures/2.jpeg")
```


```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Figure 1.3: Copper content of benthic biomass compartments over time.", out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("Figures/3.jpeg")
```


```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Figure 1.4: Iron content of benthic biomass compartments over time.", out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("Figures/4.jpeg")
```


```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Figure 1.5: Lead content of benthic biomass compartments over time.", out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("Figures/5.jpeg")
```

\newpage

Now we we get to the 2 elements that actually differ. Selenium seems to peak earlier in the season (when compared to Cd,Cu, Fe and Pb).

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Figure 1.6: Selenium content of benthic biomass compartments over time.", out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("Figures/6.jpeg")
```

And of course, as discussed before, Zn is not really present in filamentous algae. Looking at the other compartments it does not seem to present any temporal trends.

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Figure 1.7: Zinc content of benthic biomass compartments over time.", out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("Figures/7.jpeg")
```

## Principal component analyses of contents and stocks by compartment.

PCA analysis was performed in a two tier fashion. Firstly, I performed a PCA analysis on all samples using the BIG5+ elements (As,Cd,Cu,Fe,Pb,Se and Zn) for both metal contents (mg/g) and stocks (mg/m2). However, due to the high collinearity (next figure, still figuring out figure numbering in Markdown) I performed a Variance Inflation test to eliminate highly collinear variables and retain the elements that comprise the highest amount of variance. I did this independently for contents and stocks.I'm calling this group of variables "LEASTVIF".


```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Correlation plots of BIG5+ elemental contents for all biomass compartments combined.", out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("Figures/CORRPLOT_1_BIG5PLUS.jpeg")
```

\newpage

These are the PCA results for contents using the BIG5+ elements. Variables have been logged, scaled and centered.

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Prinicipal component analysis of BIG5+ elemental contents for three different biomass compartments. Secondary X and Y axes (top and right) indicate correlation between variables and principal components.", out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("Figures/PCA_1_BIG5PLUS.jpeg")
```

\newpage

Here is the correlation plot for the LEASTVIF contents dataset. Variables retained were Be,Ca,Co,Mo,Pb,S,Se,Si and Sn.

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Correlation plots of LEASTVIF elemental contents for all biomass compartments combined.", out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("Figures/CORRPLOT_1_LEAST_VIF.jpeg")
```

These are the results for contents using the LEASTVIF elements. Variables have been logged, scaled and centered.

\newpage

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Prinicipal component analysis of LEASTVIF elemental contents for three different biomass compartments. Secondary X and Y axes (top and right) indicate correlation between variables and principal components.", out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("Figures/PCA_1_LEASTVIF.jpeg")
```

\newpage

Here are the results for stocks for BIG5 and LEASTVIF:

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Prinicipal component analysis of BIG5+ elemental stocks for three different biomass compartments. Secondary X and Y axes (top and right) indicate correlation between variables and principal components.", out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("Figures/PCA_2_BIG5PLUS.jpeg")
```



```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Prinicipal component analysis of LEASTVIF elemental stocks for three different biomass compartments. Secondary X and Y axes (top and right) indicate correlation between variables and principal components.", out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("Figures/PCA_2_LEASTVIF.jpeg")
```


\newpage

Next steps are to extract PCA scores for samples and see how they vary with time and pigment contents.
